# Web Development Project 1
Our first Web Development project which involved building a website using templating on a subject of our choice. The project was built using HTML and CSS along with the minor inclusion of JavaScript for a custom google maps integration. 

The site is responsive except for the navbar as we were to use a minimal amount of JavaScript and I did not want to use a CSS checkbox hack to create a hamburger menu.

A compiled and modified version of the site can be viewed at [www.celticboxcup.ie](http://www.celticboxcup.ie).

## Installation
Install Harp (See Built With heading for link). Clone the project to a directory. Navigate in command prompt to the directory the project was cloned to. To start the server run the following command:
```sh
harp server
```
In a browser of your choice visit [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view the website.
